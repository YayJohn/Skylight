Now:
Sliding
Add a grappling hook (swing-like)
Add a grappling hook (pulling yourself to a point)
Make a Score (and tricks) system
Make a delay before you fall down from the wall when wall jumping

After:
Make a PROPER swinging system
Give bonus score points if u do a 720 or a 1080 etc
make it that when u spin it shows u that you're getting points but if u dont succeed the spin then the points will get lost
Add a settings menu which includes, resolution, fps cap and fov slider

To Fix:
//Make Jump GetKeyDown

Maybe:
Dashing
